Title: Controller Layer for Biomon App Data Analysis
Author: Rodrigo Buhler
Maintainer: Rodrigo Buhler <rodrigo.buhler@ymail.com>
Description: Biomon app is a software for data analysis automation in Biomonitoring. 
            The implementation is split in three packages taking into account the 
            development model Models-Views-Controllers. Each of these layers supported 
            by a different package: The package Analyz concerns the Models layer of Biomon app; 
            BiomonCore concerns the Controllers layer and Biomon concerns the Views 
            layer. BiomonCore delivers two classes, the class Global prepares the global 
            environment for Biomon app execution and the class Action that delivers 
            methods to deal with the user's requests from the interface, the View layer, and 
            forward them to the methods defined in the Model layer.
